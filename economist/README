Setup instructions:
1. Create 'thera' db:
CREATE SCHEMA `thera` DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci ;

2. Apply thera_v1.0.0.sql

3. Change db (and mail) config if needed in application.properties
You can override application.properties file by putting a copy in config/thera folder (not conf/thera) in your tomcat folder e.g. C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.55\config\thera

6. Run application on Tomcat
NOTE: Thera is using Java1.7 and it doesn't have embedded Tomcat. (You need to add Tomcat7 in Servers view and deploy projects.)

7. Start using application:
http://localhost:8080/thera
